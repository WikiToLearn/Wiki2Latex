Notes:
- The Namespace LaTeX is undefined, can it be useful? User can define templates.
- The documentation comments are used also to signal relevant parts of code which need corrections.

TODO:
- Translate w2l messages in w2lMessages.php, translate in italian and restore english.


Notes on Parser:
- maskLatexCommandChars: is str_replace correct??
- maybe the 'insert_includeonly' and 'leave_noinclude' config values should be user defined, now their values are defined in the class itself.
